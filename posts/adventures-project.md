I have recently created a project to document and plan future adventures. I have implemented a Leaflet.js map on a NextJS frontend. I faced challenges acquiring the necessary data to show the countries and giving priority to certain layers of the map. After a few attempts of trial and error, the solution is fairly elegant.

Once the map was initiated I worked on adding a header and a modal. The modal required the use of nextJS's portal to allow it to be inserted into the DOM.

## Future challenges:
- Change modal state via map click, research into javascript functions
- Add backend API with adventure data
