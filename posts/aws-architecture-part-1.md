As mentioned in a previous blog post, I'd like to start looking at creating an API that is callable for my blog. I'd like to practice my database management and to also have a look at hosting services. I have some previous experience using the AWS platform, hosting API's using either the EC2 or Lambda services to host my server.

AWS has good documentation on using their services to create an application with scaleable architecture. Due to the low costs of their serverless functions, and their novelty, I'd like to explore the Lambda functions again.

I came across this [page with how to get started] and followed the pages until I found the project example I would like to follow [here]. A page on the structure that could be used to host my serveless application. I hope to follow this in a future article.
