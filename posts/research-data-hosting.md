Currently my posts are being hosted statically through a .md file. I set out to research the best ways of hosting blog content.

I found that keeping data static would be the best way to provide a fast loading website, especially as the only user is me with not much data. However, I hope to learn how to build fully scalable website, with multiple users. So, I'm going to go ahead and start looking at creating my own API.

NextJS has documentation on using app routers and page routers found [here]. I'll need to go into more detail to decide my approach. But after reading a [discussion], my current thoughts are routing using the App router.

I have previous experience hosting servers on Amazons EC2 and hope to explore the use of AWS's again.
