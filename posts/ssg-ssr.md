The first post. After following the tutorial for a Next.JS blog, it's up and running and deployed on Vercel.

Posts are currently being stored using markdown files and I hope to add images to these.

(Update "30/07/2023": I am hosting the images publicly on google drive for now and used the simplified link version to make them accessible, this is a short term solution until I add server hosted blog posts. See blog post )

Things I learnt:

- NextJS's pre-rendering and static generation handling is very easy to use.
- Deployment to Vercel

Challenges:

- Updating the image on the blog posts. The image file name is stored under a separate section of the layout.js file. I need to explore this more as I am still unsure how the file chooses each image for the index or blog posts. I will add an image here of the section of code I think is commanding this.

- Changes were needed for github credentials as I was using a separate account. I had to use this page "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15381198/remove-credentials-from-git" to clear credentials held in the windows password manager.
